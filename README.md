# Etch-A-Sketch

A project that combines HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create a user-controlled color changing grid. The user has the option to resize the grid from the default 16x16, up to but not including 100x100. The grid will retain its default container pixel dimensions and the actual grid squares will vary in dimensions to fill up the container.
